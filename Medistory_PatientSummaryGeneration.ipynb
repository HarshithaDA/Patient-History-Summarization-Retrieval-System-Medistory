Her medical history is significant for hypertension and asthma, with a family history of asthma in her mother. Physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds bilaterally and tenderness in the right upper quadrant upon deep palpation.  The primary diagnosis is asthma exacerbation with bronchitis, with differentials including COPD, lung cancer, and pneumonia.  The plan is to order spirometry, a chest x-ray, and bloodwork, and to start the patient on bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and long-acting bronchodilators.  A follow-up appointment in one week and a referral to pulmonology will be arranged. '}\n"
