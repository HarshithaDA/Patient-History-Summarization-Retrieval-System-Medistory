            "A 45-year-old Caucasian female teacher with a history of asthma presented with a chronic cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and difficulty sleeping for the past three months. Physical examination revealed bilateral wheezing on auscultation and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Vital signs were stable, though the respiratory rate was elevated at 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was slightly reduced at 95%. The primary diagnosis is asthma exacerbation with pneumonia, with differential considerations including COPD, bronchiectasis, and lung cancer. The plan includes diagnostic imaging (chest X-ray and CT scan), laboratory tests, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and follow-up in one week with a referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation.\n"
